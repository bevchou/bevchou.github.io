<p>The second part of this week's assignment was to change my classmate's code. I started with Chengchao's sketch. </p>

<p>I changed his code to add some more color.</p>

<p>I added some color when the mouse is pressed, but creating a variable, colorOn, that was true when the mouse was pressed. Using this variable, I was able to activate some random colors on the blinking colors on the left of the sketch.</p>

<p>I also wanted to make bouncing circle change colors everytime it hit a wall. I did this by inserting some color changing code in the if-then statements he had to switch the circle's direction when it hit a wall.</p>

<p>I also made some smaller changes, like changing the blinking shapes on the left to squares and making the slider move faster when dragged.</p>
