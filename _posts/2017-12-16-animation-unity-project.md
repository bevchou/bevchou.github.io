<p>For my Unity project, I made an interactive exploration game where you can control a woman walking through the desert. You use the arrow keys to make her go forward, backward, left, and right. You can use the space bar to jump.</p>
<p>Overall, the process of putting everything together was pretty straightforward. I started by creating a character in Fuse, and the exporting it to Mixamo. The only issue was that Chrome wouldn't run WebGL on my computer so I needed to work with Mixamo in Safari. After I exported my rigged character, I made sure to change the rig to "Humonoid" when importing into Unity. I'm not sure why, but none of the textures were automatically applied when I imported my character. I needed to apply them all by dragging on dropping them, but that was pretty simple. Next I used theÂ Asset Store to get a desert scene. I wanted to add some objects for the character to collect while running through the desert, but I think I will try to add that later.</p>
<p>Here is the C# script that I used to make the character's controls work.</p>

<p>Some other issues that I had to work out in Unity were making sure the capsule collider was the right size so that my character didn't look like she was floating off the ground. Also, I added two light sources which created two shadows from my character. I learned in class that you can turn off shadows for your lighting, so now it looks a little more realistic.</p>
<p>Another problem I had was with exporting my project. It kept getting hung up when it was baking the light maps, and I ended up finding the solution in <a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/light-transport-problem-with-large-objects.310405/">this thread</a>. I needed to lower the resolution so that it could export my file faster.</p>
<p>Overall, I definitely would like to explore the other capabilities of Unity outside of making games. I will take a closer look at what is possible in the future.</p>
