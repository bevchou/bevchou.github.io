My previous idea definitely had some holes in it regard to why people would find value in the air space I was wanting people to buy. They buy it and it's there but then what?

I think major idea around of air rights is that there is value in the potential of the space to become a development that will have a bigger return on investment. I want to use this same logic but think about valuing the potential of the space to be preserved. Because we live in a country of capitalism, how do we to put a value on preservation that is competitive with development?

The concept of ecosystem services or natural capital tries to answer that. To me this is basically how environmental scientists are trying to translate the importance of our natural ecosystems to policy makers (& other economic influencers) through those $$$$ values. In regards to air, plants (especially larger areas of woodland, rainforests, etc) provide air purification services, which is considered a regulating service. Tony Jupiter's DEFRA report also refers to the addition of trees in urban ecosystems as "green infrastructure" that improve air quality, drainage, noise pollution, uptake carbon, etc.

Ok so the updated idea! I still want to keep my container of plants, but have the plants promote the natural capital that they are generating. They are connected to little translation devices with little LCD screens that allow them to communicate with us.

The plants will tell us about the natural capital they are generating while also keeping track of the air quality in the space. When the air quality is good (need to determine how to calibrate the thresholds of VOCs and CO2 for this), someone can pay (price determined by data on ecosystem services) to enjoy some of this air until the air quality drops to an undesirable level. Once the air quality goes back up, someone else can pay to enjoy the air.

<!-- small groups people are allowed to enjoy the natural capital (cleaner air) until it drops below a certain threshold. At this point, the plants will tell you to give them some space and generate a receipt telling you the monetary value of your breathing near the plant. -->


I found a database of studies on "economic value of environmental assets and human health effects" called Environmental Valuation Reference Inventory (EVRI). I plan on using it to inform the
