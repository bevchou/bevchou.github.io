For this assignment, I was going to try to make concrete poems from the text messages sent between me and my contacts, but it kind of felt a violation of privacy. Anyways, I took a short sentence from [Maggie Nelson's Bluets](https://www.wavepoetry.com/products/bluets) and added my own take on it. Here's the snippet from Bluets.

I don't have blue eyes, unlike the author, so I thought about what it would be like to look at the world through blue eyes. I generated a grid of blue i's. They're kind of like bars.

All of the code is available on my github [here](https://github.com/bevchou/computational-approaches-to-typography/tree/master/3_concrete_poetry).
