<p>This week, I worked on using both digital and analog components with my Arduino. I wanted to use a photoresistor, an analog component, but I first started all with digital inputs to make sure I wired and programmed my Arduino correct. I initially forgot to connect my switch to high voltage, which caused the signal from the button switch to be inconsistent. I fixed the issue after noticing my LED not lighting properly. I made this code:<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/bevchou/d939ab704b61ebc9a6361a665d600af9.js"></script><br />
And after fixing my button switch circuit, it worked to light up my LED.<br />

<p>Next, I knew I needed replace the button switch, except I would need to wire it to the analog pins on the Arduino. I wanted more lights to light up based on how much light the photoresistor sensed. If it sensed more light, then more of the LEDs would light up. Â Here is what my circuit diagram looks like:<br />

And then this is the code I created:<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/bevchou/a943702e687438f56e35e90cb9bc9072.js"></script><br />
Which then yielded this:<br />
