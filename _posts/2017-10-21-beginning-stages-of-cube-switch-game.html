<p>For the P Comp midterm, Marco Wylie and I are working on a game that is kind of mash-up of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bop_It">bop-it</a> and a <a href="https://www.thefidgetcube.co/products/fidget-cube">fidget cube</a>. The device will be a box with LEDs and various switches/buttons on 5 sides (one side will have a handle and the on/off and start buttons). Our intention for how the user will interact with the game is below.</p>

<ul>
<li>Flip the power switch to on.</li>
<li>Press "start" button to activate it.</li>
<li>An LED on a random side will light up and the user will have 10 seconds to hit the switch on the corresponding side.
<ul>
<li>If the user successfully hits the switch in time, another random side will light up and the user will have 9 seconds to hit the switch on that side... and so on. The time to hit each switch will decrease by 1 second every time.</li>
<li>If the user misses the switch in the allotted time, they lose and all the LEDs will flash. The game is over.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the game ends, the user can hit the start button to play again. Or turn off the power when he/she is done.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am currently working on building the basic circuit and Arduino program for this. Here is the circuit that I built. It has pots, buttons, and LEDs that are each connected to the appropriate digital and analog pins.</p>

<p>So far I have set up the code so that I can get the LEDs to light up randomly when a button is pressed. I will need to add to the code so each LED is tied its button and so that it is connect to a timing system. Here is a short video and the code I have so far for the random LEDs lighting up.</p>
