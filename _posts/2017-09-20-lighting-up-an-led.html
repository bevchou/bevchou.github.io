<p>This week, I worked on creating some simple circuits with an LED. First I started by setting up my breadboard, using my Arduino to provide 5V power to the board.</p>

<p>I first started by making a circuit with an LED. I knew I drew my circuit diagram first, so I could see how to lay out my components on the board. I used a 220Î© resistor because I knew it would lower the current to 22.7mA using Ohm's Law. I grabbed the LED from the shop, so I'm not sure of what its specs are, but most LEDs seem to have a forward current of 20mA.</p>

<p>I translated this to my breadboard, and the LED lit up!</p>

<p>Next, I added a switch to my circuit diagram.</p>

<p>I used a button switch and it was a success!</p>
