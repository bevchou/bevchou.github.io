I finished up my field guide and overall it was a good process. My research felt more strucutred at the beginning amd the it eventually kind of got to a point where I wasn't keeping track as well. At this point, I knew exactly what info I needed to fill in so I would seek it out, and then just toss a link at the end of my [Dropbox Paper document](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Temporary-Expert-Field-Guide--APy8AlrC4AzDTYeIKd4WyoLFAg-pwGWDmvUEWykrn3mD5bJf) where I was tracking all of my research resources. Some parts didn't really require a lot of research, and were more reflections of how I feel.

Other parts required that I looked deeper into academic research. Especially when learning about the carbon cycle in urban environments. It took more time to find the right resources and write a simple explanation of something that's part of such a big interconnected system.

Marina provided a lot of solid feedback from the previous work-in-progress version. I took into account most of the feedback - more spacious margins, typos, layout changes. I wanted to extend the cover illustration across the back, but ran out of time.

Overall, it's not perfect, but I'm happy with how to came out. I showed it to some friends and they thought it was a fun experience. I'm glad I was able to go through the process, albeit quickly, and doing a field guide is a great way to frame a topic.
