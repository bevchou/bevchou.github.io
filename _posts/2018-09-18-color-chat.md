I wanted to make a simple chat where users can change the color of the chat box by entering in hex colors. I think colors can convey a lot of emotion and it's an interesting way to communicate without words. I wanted to find a nicer way to have users select their color, but for now it's tailored around the ease of working with CSS. For now, I have some error messages that show up when you don't enter your color in the correct hexidecimal format.

I'm not sure how to make my server run forever - it seems to close whenever I log out of my digital ocean droplet. Here is the [intended link](http://159.65.181.189:8080/index.html), which I can start serving whenever I need to from Terminal.
