<p>We went over the basics of After Effects last week, and now I've made a simple animation. Here's a cat doing jumping jacks in a place where gravity apparently isn't as strong as on Earth.</p>

<p>I'm totally aware that the simplicity of my cartoon cat is not following many of the rules of animation we've discussed - the cat looks pretty stiff - but I'm still figuring out how to time things out &amp; animating limbs. The weird thing is that the playback doesn't seem to be in realtime on After Effects I think.</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot of the animating the limbs using the transform tools in the bottom left.</p>

<p>And again here is my composition inside another composition where the entire cat is translating up and down. You can also see my trying to match the speed graph to what I think might convey a jump.<p/>
