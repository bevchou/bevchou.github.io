For my breadboard ATtiny85 circuit, I've decided to control my LED using a toggle switch. On one setting the LED will blink. When toggled to the other setting, the LED will fade up and down. The video above shows it working. I followed the demo we did in class to program the ATtiny85 through the Arduino.</p>

<p>These are the steps that I followed.<br />

<ol>
<li>Upload the ArduinoISP program onto the Arduino</li>
<li>Burn the bootloader for the ATtiny85</li>
<li>Change the board to the ATtiny85 and upload my code</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a drawing of my circuit diagram.<br />
