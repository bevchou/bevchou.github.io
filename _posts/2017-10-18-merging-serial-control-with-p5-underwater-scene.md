<p>I am starting to use asynchronous serial communication to connect what we are doing with the Arduino in P Comp with what we are doing with p5 in ICM. It's pretty exciting with all the new possibilities, but first I wanted to see if I could use two sensors to make changes in a <a href="https://beverlychou.com/itp/2017/10/01/icm-week-4/">pre-existing p5 sketch I had</a>.</p>

<p>First I set up my breadboard and Arduino. As I've done many times before, I have a simple set up with my potentiometer and photoresistor connected to the analog inputs.</p>

<p>I wanted to use my potentiometer and my photoresistor to make changes to my sketch. To keep it simple and so I could see the direct change, I decided to play with the size of the creatures and bubbles in my underwater sketch. First, I wanted to get the sensor values from my Arduino. Here is my code I loaded up to the Arduino.</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/bevchou/b7a55693af6ceeaa1ab2f8ff43e43033.js"></script></p>
<p>As you can see, the values coming out of the Arduino will be a string that looks like "photoresistor value, potentiometer value". I made sure to separate the values with a comma so I could later use the split() function in javascript to store the sensor values in an array. Note: only code relevant to serial communication is shown.</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/bevchou/97baa5ec290e821b1c156132f62cba07.js"></script></p>
<p>Now, I had a "factor1" controlled by the potentiometer and a "factor2" controlled by the photoresistor. I used these variables as size factors in the functions for the jellyfish, fish, and bubbles. A small gif of the sketch in action is below. You can see when I turn the potentiometer the fish change size, and then when I cover and uncover the photoresistor the bubbles change size.</p>

<p>Now I am thinking of new ways to combine different interactions on the screen with physical interactions that can be detected by sensors. Reworking this early p5 sketch has been a good exercise, and I am planning on making something where the actions caused by the physical interactions make more sense.</p>
