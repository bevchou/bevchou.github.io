<p>For this week, I focused on creating a sketch that would use functions to help organize my code and cut down on repetition. My sketch is below, and the full code is available <a href="https://alpha.editor.p5js.org/bevchou/sketches/S1DejF6iZ">here</a>.</p>

<p>At the beginning, I created a gradient. I discovered the lerpColor() function, which could interpolate colors between two chosen colors. I made the following code to create the gradient look for my water. The more "layers" that are added created a more smooth gradient as shown in the gif below.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/bevchou/abfcc6bcc3072dbbbf16641be8163c02.js"></script></p>
<p>Then I made a function to draw a fish where the arguments allowed me to position the fish, pick its color, and scale it.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/bevchou/ab51ef99652315cd61463adec39b4c85.js"></script></p>
<p>I also created a function that would allow different parts of my drawing to continually loop across the screen. I made one to loop in the x direction and another to loop in the y direction. I applied this to my fish and also some bubbles I added (with functions!)</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/bevchou/d1d5fed663d0b712a31d659130cd80be.js"></script></p>
<p>I added a function to draw a jellyfish, which was similar to the function to draw a fish, to make it more interesting. I did not like how many times I called the different functions. This is what a lot of the code in my draw() function looked like.</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/bevchou/443edfd6c85f1ed9159791bc28960c0d.js"></script></p>
<p>Is there a way to maybe store the info (position, scale, color) in another location and then call the fish() function using a loop to create many fish? Is this what arrays will help me do? I guess I will find out when I go to class and watch the rest of the Coding Train videos.</p>
