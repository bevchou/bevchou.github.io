I liked the visuals of the old school ANSI games, and so I wanted to play with the word "snake" and allow someone to control it using the arrow keys on their keyboard. It's pretty simple and there's no game rules. It's sort of zen and you can just be the snake in the terminal.

All of the code is available on my github [here](https://github.com/bevchou/computational-approaches-to-typography/tree/master/1_ANSI_Terminal).
