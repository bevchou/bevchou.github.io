<p>An update to the progress of the game we are making for our midterm P Comp project. We currently have the circuit working without any count down timer. In the video below you can see that I am hitting the start button on the far right to activate the game. Next, I am matching the button I press to the LED that is lit up.</p>

<p>You have noticed that the analog pots are now replaced with buttons, and this was done just to simplify. As time allows, we will make some functions to allow us to switch out the buttons for different analog sensors.</p>
