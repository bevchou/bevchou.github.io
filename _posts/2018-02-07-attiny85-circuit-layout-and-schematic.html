<p>Using Eagle, I took my breadboard circuit into a PCB design! I modified the circuit schematic we worked on together in class to work for my chosen sensor, which is the toggle switch. It has three pinouts: ground, signal, and power. It will connect to the inputs where it says "JP2" on the schematic.</p>

<p>From there, I drew the copper connections on the PCB in the board layout below. I avoided doing any air-wires. I'm a little bit worried about if there is enough space between the copper lines, but hopefully it will be fine!</p>

<p>Also, I finished soldering my programming jig for the ATTiny85.</p>
