This post is still in progress!!

For my portrait, I wanted to reflect what a significant amount of my time actually looks like. Like a lot of people (& ITPers especially), I probably spend several hours a day looking at screens to get my work done, communicate with people, look for the BEST place to eat, etc. It's actually really boring what's happening in real life vs the excitement of being on the Internet, so here is a piece of media about me experiencing media.

The proximity of your mouse to the exit button determines which frame of the video is shown. The close you are to closing the window, the closer you are to the end of the video. I need to fix the video so it shows the progression better (also the file is waaaay to huge), but overall it works sluggishly. I'm planning on updating this post with a better version in the future!
